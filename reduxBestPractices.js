/**
 * Redux Best Practices
 *
 * Introduction:
 * Redux is a state management library that helps manage application state
 * in a predictable way. This document outlines best practices for using
 * Redux in your applications to promote maintainability, scalability, and
 * ease of testing.
 */

/**
 * State Structure:
 * - Flat State Structure: Keep your state tree flat to avoid deep nesting.
 *   This simplifies access and updates.
 * - Normalization: Use normalized data structures to avoid redundancy.
 *   Store entities by ID and create lookup tables for related data.
 *
 * Example:
 * {
 *   users: {
 *     byId: {
 *       '1': { id: '1', name: 'John' },
 *       '2': { id: '2', name: 'Jane' },
 *     },
 *     allIds: ['1', '2'],
 *   },
 * }
 */

/**
 * Actions:
 * - Action Types: Define action types as constants to avoid typos and
 *   improve maintainability.
 * - Action Creators: Use action creators to encapsulate the creation of
 *   actions. This keeps your code DRY.
 *
 * Example:
 * // actionTypes.js
 * export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';
 *
 * // actions.js
 * export const addTodo = (text) => ({
 *   type: ADD_TODO,
 *   payload: text,
 * });
 */

/**
 * Reducers:
 * - Pure Functions: Keep reducers as pure functions. They should not mutate
 *   the state directly.
 * - Combine Reducers: Use combineReducers to split the root reducer into
 *   smaller, manageable pieces.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
 * import todosReducer from './todosReducer';
 * import usersReducer from './usersReducer';
 *
 * const rootReducer = combineReducers({
 *   todos: todosReducer,
 *   users: usersReducer,
 * });
 *
 * export default rootReducer;
 */

/**
 * Store:
 * - Single Store: Use a single Redux store for your application state to
 *   maintain a single source of truth.
 * - Enhancers: Use enhancers for middleware and store dev tools to improve
 *   development experience.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
 * import rootReducer from './reducers';
 * import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
 *
 * const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
 */

/**
 * Middleware:
 * - Use Middleware: Apply middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga for
 *   handling asynchronous actions and side effects.
 * - Logging Middleware: Implement logging middleware to monitor actions
 *   and state changes during development.
 *
 * Example:
 * const logger = store => next => action => {
 *   console.log('Dispatching:', action);
 *   return next(action);
 * };
 */

/**
 * Connecting Components:
 * - Use connect: Utilize react-redux's connect function to connect your
 *   components to the Redux store.
 * - Map State and Dispatch: Use mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps
 *   for selecting state and dispatching actions.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { connect } from 'react-redux';
 * import { addTodo } from './actions';
 *
 * const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
 *   todos: state.todos,
 * });
 *
 * const mapDispatchToProps = { addTodo };
 *
 * export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyComponent);
 */

/**
 * Selectors:
 * - Create Selectors: Use selectors for accessing state. This encapsulates
 *   state access and improves testability.
 * - Reselect: Consider using the reselect library for memoized selectors
 *   to optimize performance.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { createSelector } from 'reselect';
 *
 * const getTodos = (state) => state.todos;
 *
 * export const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(
 *   [getTodos],
 *   (todos) => todos.filter(todo => !todo.completed)
 * );
 */

/**
 * Testing:
 * - Test Reducers: Write tests for your reducers to ensure they return
 *   the correct state.
 * - Test Action Creators: Validate that action creators return the
 *   correct actions.
 * - Test Components: Use react-testing-library or enzyme for testing
 *   connected components.
 *
 * Example:
 * import { addTodo } from './actions';
 *
 * test('addTodo action creator', () => {
 *   const expectedAction = {
 *     type: ADD_TODO,
 *     payload: 'Learn Redux',
 *   };
 *   expect(addTodo('Learn Redux')).toEqual(expectedAction);
 * });
 */

/**
 * Conclusion:
 * Following these best practices will help you create scalable and
 * maintainable applications with Redux. Consistently review and update
 * your practices as the Redux ecosystem evolves.
